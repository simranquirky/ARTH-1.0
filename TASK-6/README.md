## THE ARCHITECTURE INCLUDES:
- Web server configured on EC2 instance.
- Document Root(var/www/html) made persistent by mounting on EBS Block Device.
- Static Objects used in code such as pictures stored in S3
- Setting up content delivery network using Cloudfront and using the domain as S3 bucket.
- Finally place the Cloudfront URL on the webapp code for security and low latency.
### 1. LAUNCH AN EC2 INSTANCE
We have discussed the way to launch an instance using aws cli, in our previous Article . Click here to read it.

Use putty to login to your launced instance or simply press on the connect button (in case of amazonâ€™s private linux image). By doing this you will get the terminal window of the launched instance , so that you can proceed forward.

### 2. INSTALL APACHE SERVER ON THE INSTANCE
In the terminal type in the commands below

Command line 1: sudo su root

Command line 2: yum install httpd

The above command installs the httpd server in your EC2 instance.

WEb server installation through cli
Now you need to start the httpd services using the command :

`systemctl start httpd`

You can confirm that your services has started successfully by running the command:

`systemctl status httpd`

amazon cli
### 3.CREATE A VOLUME AND ATTACH IT TO THE INSTANCE LAUNCHED
We have discussed the way to create an ebs volume of definite size and to attach it to a particular instance using aws cli in our previous Article . Click here to read it.

### 4. CREATE PARTITION, FORMAT IT AND THEN MOUNT IT TO MAKE IT PERSISTENT
#### Create a partition:

`fdisk /dev/xvdf`

partition creation through AWS
#### Format the partition:

`mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf`

cli of amazon
#### Mount the partition:

`mount /dev/xvdf /var/www/html`

You can confirm the successful mounting of the partition using the command:

`df -h`

aws cli
### 5. CREATE A S3 BUCKET AND UPLOAD AN IMAGE AND MAKE IT PUBLIC
In order to create an S3 bucket run:

`aws s3api create-bucket --acl public-read-write --bucket <bucket_name> --region <region> --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=<region>`

creating bucket thrugh aws
For uploading the image to the bucket use:

`aws s3 cp <local_address_of_file> s3://<bucket_name>`

command line of amazon
The main step includes to make the object public which can be done using:

`aws s3api put_object_acl --bucket <bucket_name> --key <file_name> --acl public-read`

aws commnad line
### 6 . CREATE A CLOUDFRONT DISTRIBUTION
Use command given below to create cloudfront distribution:

`aws cloudfront create-distribution --origin-domain-name <bucket_name>.s3.amazonaws.com`

creating cloudfront through AWS
cloudfront
### 7. CREATE HTML FILE AS PER YOUR WISH AND ADD OBJECT FILE TO IT
Create html file according to your own desire.

`cd /var/www/html`

`vi <html_file _name>`

Use your knowledge of html ,css etc, to creatively decorate the page.

Add object to the file using the domain name you recieved while creatig the cloudfront distribution

Url: `http://<domain_name_ending_with_cloudfront.net>/<file_name>`

html file configuration
### 8. VISIT YOUR WEBPAGE
The webpage url: http:/<public_ip>/<html_file_name>
